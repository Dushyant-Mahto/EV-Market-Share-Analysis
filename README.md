# EV Market Analysis in India (2015–2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Indian EV market is rapidly expanding, but challenges remain in **charging infrastructure** and **regional adoption rates**.  
This project simulates a client request:  
👉 *"If a new EV company enters India, what segment (2W/4W) should they focus on, and which states to prioritize?"*

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Identify **which EV category** (2W, 3W, 4W) has the strongest growth & opportunities.
2. Analyze **state-wise EV adoption vs charging infrastructure**.
3. Understand **competitive positioning of top makers** (Tata, Ola, etc.).
4. Provide **business recommendations** for market entry.

## 📊 Datasets
- **EV Sales by State (2015–2024)**  
- **EV Charging Stations by State**  
- **EV Sales by Maker & Category**  
- Sources: Open datasets (kaggle datasets).

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Top States by EV Sales**:  
  1. Uttar Pradesh  
  2. Maharashtra  
  3. Karnataka  
  4. Delhi  
  5. Rajasthan  
  6. Bihar  
  7. Tamil Nadu  
  8. Gujarat  
  9. Assam  
  10. Kerala  

- **EVs per Charging Station (Infra Gap)**:  
  Bihar, Assam, Tripura, UP, MP, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Uttarakhand  
  → These states show **charging infra bottlenecks**.  

- **Segment Insights**:  
  - **2W EVs** dominate sales (Ola, Hero Electric).  
  - **4W EVs** led by Tata Motors.  
  - **3W EVs** remain fragmented, with scope in Eastern states.  

- **Recommendation**:  
  - New entrants should focus on **2W + 4W** categories in **high-sales states** (UP, Maharashtra, Karnataka).  
  - Target **infrastructure-weak states** (Bihar, Assam, Tripura) for early-mover advantage in charging infra partnerships.
